<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

The aim of this project is to create a calculator web application, with basic functionality.
This is intended to be a learning-based project. It is not meant to be a tool for practical use.
This project was initially made as an assignment for the Developers' Society (DevSoc) of BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.

<!-- PRESENT STATUS -->
## Present Status

Currently, the calculator has basic arithmetic functionality (with DMAS), and basic buttons are also working.
The expression to be evaluated may be entered using the on-screen buttons, or the keyboard, and the answer is displayed upon clicking the 'equals' button.

### Some Features:
* Keyboard support:
    * Digits, Operators and Period are bound to their respective keys.
    * Enter, Spacebar or Equals may be used to display the answer.
    * Backspace or Delete may be used to delete one character from the screen.
    * Escape may be used to clear the screen.
* Invalid expression checking:
    * If the expression entered for evaluation is invalid, an error message is shown.
    * The error message is not persistent; it is visible for a delay of one second, and then disappears.
* Responsiveness:
    * Although media queries have not been used, certain design considerations have been made while creating the calculator which allow it to be scaled to smaller screens.
* Easter egg:
    * Use the keyboard to discover this feature :).
